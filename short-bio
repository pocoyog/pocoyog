Hi my name is Arielle Fritz B. Layug, most of the time people tend to mistakenly judge me as a girl because of my name but don't worry as those kind of stuff entertains me. I'm simply an outgoing person with a humorous take at life, where I feel everything should be mixed with joy on whatever we do in life.
